# Smart Entity Extraction & Document Clustering: Highlights, Concept & Future Directions

## Project Concept & Overview
This project is a professional, no-code web app for extracting structured information from unstructured documents (PDFs), generating semantic embeddings, and clustering similar documents. It leverages state-of-the-art NLP (spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, sentence-transformers) and modern UI (Streamlit) to make advanced document analytics accessible to everyone.

## Use Cases
1. **Business & M&A Due Diligence**: Sort and cluster contracts, company profiles, or legal documents. Extract key organizations, dates, and people for compliance or risk review.
2. **Academic & Research**: Cluster research papers by topic. Extract and analyze named entities (institutions, chemicals, authors) from scientific PDFs.
3. **Legal & Compliance**: Organize and summarize legal case files. Identify and group documents by involved parties, dates, or case types.
4. **Competitive Intelligence**: Scrape and cluster startup/competitor websites or press releases. Extract product names, organizations, and events for market analysis.
5. **HR & Recruitment**: Cluster and analyze resumes/CVs. Extract skills, companies, and education entities for talent mapping.
6. **Government & Policy**: Analyze and cluster policy documents, regulations, or public reports. Extract organizations, locations, and dates for trend analysis.
7. **Media & Journalism**: Cluster news articles by story or topic. Extract people, organizations, and locations for investigative research.
